## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

- I was able to reuse some of the things I learned from the Base Apparel Coming Soon challenge for this solution, such as how the form elements should be structured with ARIA attributes. Something new I learned from this challenge though is that we should also use the `aria-describedby` attribute to link the Terms and Conditions text to the Submit button since it provides further information about the button
- I also learned the different available values for the `autocomplete` attribute which I was able to use here, such as `given-name` for the First Name field and `family-name` for the Last Name field

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about standard form accessibility rules and design best practices when implementing forms and custom form validation
